Artificial intelligence can spot illicit tortoiseshell with greater

With its durability and transfixing swirl of translucent amber and brown
layers, tortoiseshell has been used for centuries to make everything
from jewelry to combs to dishware.

"It was plastic before plastic was invented because it's so malleable,"
says [Brad Nahill](http://www.bradnahill.com/), co-founder and president
of turtle conservation group [SEE Turtles](https://www.seeturtles.org/)
and a [National Geographic
Explorer](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/find-explorers/brad-nahill).

Tortoiseshell does not come from tortoises. It almost exclusively comes
from the critically endangered [hawksbill
turtle](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/hawksbill-sea-turtle).
Between 1884 and 1992, [data
show](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aav5948), at least nine
million hawksbills [were killed and sold for their
shells](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/endangered-hawksbill-turtle-shell-trade-is-bigger-than-scientists-realized?loggedin=true).
Today, fewer than 25,000 breeding females remain globally, and its
international commercial trade is banned.

Nahill's group is leading an effort to use modern technology to combat
the illicit trade of this age-old material. Tortoiseshell is widely and
accurately replicated with resin, making it difficult to tell real from
fake. SEE Turtles, with partners at the [Smithsonian OCIO Data Science
Lab](https://datascience.si.edu/), built an app to help.

Named SEE Shell, the app uses machine learning to identify with 94
percent accuracy whether a photo of something with a tortoiseshell
pattern is real or faux. It's the first mobile app to use computer
vision to combat the illegal wildlife trade, according to Alexander
Robillard, a predoctoral fellow with the [Smithsonian's Data Science
Lab](https://datascience.si.edu/) who built the computer model that
powers it, and it will help inform conservation-minded shoppers and law
enforcement. (The app can be downloaded in the [Apple App
Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/see-shell-by-seeturtles-org/id1572511434){rel="noopener noreferrer"}
and [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?gl=US&hl=en_US&id=org.seeturtles.see_shell){rel="noopener noreferrer"}).

Black market sales of tortoiseshell persist in at least 40 countries,
Nahill says, concentrated largely in Central America and Southeast Asia.
Vacationing travelers buying tortoiseshell trinkets from gift shops and
souvenir booths account for the great majority of the illicit sales.

The app is also valuable for the wealth of information it can provide.
All images are uploaded to a private, centralized database, with GPS
coordinates for each, allowing SEE Turtles to identify hot spots for
illicit sales.

"Even if we get a few hundred travelers actively using it and collecting
data and avoiding buying real tortoiseshell, it's a great thing," Nahill
says. SEE Turtles plans to market the free app through social media
campaigns and partnerships with other conservation organizations.

Marine ecologist Emily Miller, who was not involved in development of
the app but authored a 2019 paper [on the global scale of the hawksbill
trade](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aav5948), says that
although many different groups around the world are collecting data on
the hawksbill trade, "one of the major barriers to answering research
questions is consolidating, formatting, and organizing all of the data."
Having a larger, centralized database "will be incredibly helpful to
understanding trade patterns globally," she says.

## Training a computer to help protect turtles

Robillard worked with Nahill's team to collect 4,000 images of real and
fake tortoiseshell products. Robillard fed those images into his
computer model, which analyzed the pixels in each to learn the
differences in shape and coloration between real and fake tortoiseshell.

A key difference, Nahill says, is that patterning on real tortoiseshell
is random. Faux products tend to have splotches with uniform edges or
the same pattern across different items that are sold together. The
orange hue in faux tortoiseshell also tends to have consistent
translucency throughout.

Nahill and Robillard are good at distinguishing the real from the fake,
but without the app, it may take years of practice for a non-expert to
develop that skill. "I like to tell people it puts Brad \[Nahill\] in
their pocket!" Robillard says of the app. Machine learning and computer
vision "can do any visual task that a human can do, but more efficiently
and rapidly," he says. (I tested SEE Shell on two pairs of
tortoiseshell-patterned eyeglasses---and right away, it identified both
as fake.)

## Swizzle sticks and more

Through the app, scientists have already come across tortoiseshell
products they didn't know existed---tortoiseshell swizzle sticks for
mixing cocktails, for example, and cock-fighting spurs.

The app will be valuable for local conservation groups. Before its
launch, [Fundación Tortugas del
Mar](https://www.facebook.com/fundaciontortugasdelmar/), a turtle
conservation group in Cartagena, Colombia, already had success engaging
local law enforcement to crack down on the trade, reducing it in the
region by nearly 80 percent. But, Nahill says, authorities only go on
patrol if someone from the conservation group accompanies them to help
identify illegal products. Tortugas del Mar plans to train law
enforcement to use the app so they can work more quickly and
independently.

David Godfrey, executive director of the [Sea Turtle
Conservancy](https://conserveturtles.org/), whose work includes efforts
to protect hawksbill turtles in Panama, a hot spot for the trade, says
that if tourists use SEE Shell, it's like equipping "an army of
conservationists to make life difficult for people selling
\[tortoiseshell\] under the table." Now that people can identify the
real thing right away, vendors may think twice about carrying it, he
says.

With help from the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, SEE Turtles also aims
to bring the technology to online platforms, which have seen a [surge in
the illegal wildlife
trade](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/how-internet-fuels-illegal-wildlife-trade?loggedin=true)
in recent years. Facebook, eBay, and others filter illegal products by
detecting listings that include prohibited keywords, but the filters are
easily evaded. "As far as we can determine, no one has done anything
visually," Nahill says.

This visual learning technology potentially can be adapted for other
wildlife materials, such as discerning real bone from fake. The ability
to identify real elephant ivory in an instant would be particularly
valuable, but it's trickier than tortoiseshell, Robillard notes, because
a key indicator of authentic ivory is its internal crosshatch lines,
which aren't visible in a photo.

Nonetheless, he says, "there's a whole world of possibilities for
applying machine learning to conservation issues."
